    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> 
        Hello! I’m Menglu Liu, an undergraduate student at Syracuse University, majoring in Computer Science. 
        My academic journey started in economics, but my passion for technology and data led me to switch to Computer Science, 
        where I’ve found a genuine interest in coding, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.
